# Mexico water analysis
This repo goes through the water level for 210 dams in the country. We'll also analyse water distribution, usage and relevant information regarding the drought Mexico is going through.

Note on units used: dam capacities and current storage in the dam_levels datasets are in cubic hectometers (from now on, hm<sup>3</sup>). <br>
1 hm<sup>3</sup> = 1,000,000,000 (1 billion liters) or 264,172,052.35 gallons.

Now, the datasets used in this report are manually cleaned versions from those provided by the mexican government and the different institutions that gather the information. Cleaning process will be automated soon. Mainly, I'll go through data provided by Comisión Nacional del Agua (CONAGUA), but I'm also using public data obtained from Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI).
